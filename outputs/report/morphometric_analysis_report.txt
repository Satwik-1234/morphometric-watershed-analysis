1. STUDY AREA DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------
The study area comprises 5 subbasins covering a total area of 316.33 km². The watershed extends from approximately 19.4703°N to 19.6474°N and 73.6357°E to 73.9081°E. Elevation ranges from 584 m to 1537 m above sea level, indicating a relief of 953 m across the watershed. The analysis utilises SRTM 30 m Digital Elevation Model data processed in a UTM projected coordinate reference system (EPSG:32643) to ensure accurate area and length computations.

2. DATA SOURCES
----------------------------------------
• DEM: Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 30 m resolution (NASA/USGS)
• Subbasins: Derived from DEM hydrological processing (5 subbasins)
• Stream network: Extracted via D8 flow routing with Strahler ordering
• Flow direction: D8 algorithm (ArcGIS/QGIS/TauDEM compatible)
• Flow accumulation: Derived from D8 flow direction
• CRS: Reprojected to UTM for accurate metric computations

3. METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
Morphometric analysis was performed following the methodologies of Horton (1945) for stream ordering and bifurcation laws, Strahler (1952, 1964) for the hierarchical stream order classification, Schumm (1956) for basin geometry and elongation ratio, and Miller (1953) for circularity ratio. Linear, areal, and relief morphometric parameters were computed at the subbasin level using SRTM DEM data and derived GIS layers. Watershed prioritization employed three independent methods: Compound Parameter Ranking, Entropy Weight Method, and PCA-Based Priority scoring, with inter-method agreement assessed using Kendall's tau.

4. MORPHOMETRIC RESULTS
----------------------------------------

4.1 Linear Aspects
  SB1: 5-order basin, 406 stream segments, Mean Bifurcation Ratio (Rbm) = 1.800. Rbm outside 3–5 range may indicate structural control.
  SB2: 5-order basin, 528 stream segments, Mean Bifurcation Ratio (Rbm) = 1.796. Rbm outside 3–5 range may indicate structural control.
  SB3: 6-order basin, 574 stream segments, Mean Bifurcation Ratio (Rbm) = 1.814. Rbm outside 3–5 range may indicate structural control.
  SB4: 6-order basin, 634 stream segments, Mean Bifurcation Ratio (Rbm) = 2.068. Rbm outside 3–5 range may indicate structural control.
  SB5: 6-order basin, 1457 stream segments, Mean Bifurcation Ratio (Rbm) = 2.522. Rbm outside 3–5 range may indicate structural control.

4.2 Areal Aspects
  SB1: Area=36.411 km², Dd=2.861 km/km², Re=1.198, Rc=0.228, Ff=1.128, Shape: Circular.
  SB2: Area=45.600 km², Dd=3.011 km/km², Re=1.198, Rc=0.306, Ff=1.128, Shape: Circular.
  SB3: Area=54.460 km², Dd=2.873 km/km², Re=1.198, Rc=0.257, Ff=1.128, Shape: Circular.
  SB4: Area=60.701 km², Dd=3.036 km/km², Re=1.198, Rc=0.281, Ff=1.128, Shape: Circular.

4.3 Relief Aspects
  SB1: H=953 m, Rh=0.16774, Rn=2.727, HI=0.262, Stage: Peneplain (Old/Concave).
  SB2: H=953 m, Rh=0.14989, Rn=2.869, HI=0.262, Stage: Peneplain (Old/Concave).
  SB3: H=953 m, Rh=0.13715, Rn=2.738, HI=0.262, Stage: Peneplain (Old/Concave).
  SB4: H=953 m, Rh=0.12991, Rn=2.893, HI=0.262, Stage: Peneplain (Old/Concave).
  SB5: H=953 m, Rh=0.09272, Rn=3.061, HI=0.262, Stage: Peneplain (Old/Concave).

5. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Mean drainage density across all subbasins: 2.998 km/km². Moderate to low drainage density suggests permeable materials and gentle topography. PCA revealed that the first two principal components explained the majority of total variance (74.7% + 15.5% = 90.2%), with drainage density and relief parameters dominating PC1 and basin shape parameters dominating PC2.

6. WATERSHED PRIORITIZATION
----------------------------------------
Three independent methods identified the following priority classes:
  HIGH priority basins (most susceptible to erosion): SB1, SB5
  MODERATE priority basins: SB2, SB4
  LOW priority basins: SB3
Inter-method agreement (Kendall's τ): M1 vs M2 = 0.527, M1 vs M3 = 0.316, M2 vs M3 = 0.800. Moderate agreement suggests parameter-sensitivity in ranking.

7. DISCUSSION
----------------------------------------
Drainage Density Implications:
  The watershed exhibits a mean Dd of 2.998 km/km². High Dd values indicate fine texture, less permeable lithology, and greater surface runoff propensity (Horton, 1945). Basins with Dd > 3.5 are expected to respond rapidly to rainfall events, increasing flood risk.

Shape and Runoff Response:
  Mean Elongation Ratio (Re) = 1.198. Sub-circular to circular basins (Re > 0.7) generate higher and faster flood peaks. Form factor and circularity ratio confirm this assessment.

Relief and Erosion:
  Mean Ruggedness Number (Rn) = 2.858. High Rn reflects steep slopes combined with high drainage density, indicating high erosion potential and flash flood susceptibility (Strahler, 1964).

Hypsometric Stage:
  Mean Hypsometric Integral (HI) = 0.262. HI < 0.35 indicates peneplain/old stage — reduced erosion activity.

8. CONCLUSION
----------------------------------------
This study presents a comprehensive morphometric analysis of a 5-subbasin watershed using SRTM 30 m DEM. The integrated analysis of linear, areal, and relief parameters reveals the geomorphic maturity, erosion susceptibility, and hydrological response characteristics of each subbasin. Subbasins SB1, SB5 are identified as highest priority for soil and water conservation interventions based on convergent evidence from three independent prioritization methods. Findings are reproducible and suitable for integration into watershed management planning frameworks.
